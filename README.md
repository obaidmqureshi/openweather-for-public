assignment from prudention
This is the assignment that was assigned as part of the interview procedure. It was not mentioned what automation tool was to be used hence 
i have taken the liberty to use Python language with selenium and  Robotframework .I could have done it with Protractor but faced some installation error and did not wanted to jeopardise my existing project data. 
I have come up with 5 test cases covering all the accetance criteria assigned. 

Please let me know if you need me to come up with  precisly Protractor automation suite i can do it with some time . The installtion is always tedious for protractor. Once that is done there arent much challanges.

Thanks and Regards
Obaid Ahmed M Qureshi
